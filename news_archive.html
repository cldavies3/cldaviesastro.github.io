					<p>For the second time this year, I led a group of colleagues from the Univ. Exeter's
					Astrophysics Group to the St Loyes area of Exeter for a Star Spangled Kyrangle
					stargazing event. The event was organised in collaboration with St Loyes-based 
					community-based art project, Working With Gold, led by Clare Bryden. Even though we 
					were plagued by cloud, around thirty locals joined us in the park and enjoyed 
					looking through a telescope at Mars; learning about the starlore associated with 
					the Summer Triangle constellations, Casseopeia, and Pegasus; and engaging with
					knowledgeable astronomers at our activities table.

					<p>As part of my role within the MIRCx collaboration, I visited CHARA to conduct

					six-telescope beam combiner, MIRCx (CHARA proposal 2018A:M2) and 
					for the 2018A:M4 program to study pre-main-sequence star binary systems. On UT date 
					May 24th, with the assistance of Narsireddy Anugu, Aaron Labdon and Alex Kreplin, we
					successfully deomstrated the remote observing capabilities of MIRCx from the University
					of Exeter directly for the first time. This is a fantastic step forward in making UK-based
					MIRCx observations more economical and provides us with a training utility for future
					UK-based CHARA Array users.

					<p>For the 10th anniversary of Exeter Pride - the local LGBTQ+ festival (and largest in
					Devon) - I organised for the South West branch of the Institute of Physics to have a 
					stall in the "marketplace" area. This was the first time a science-themed stall or event
					had featured at the festival. The stall featured hands-on demonstrations of physics and
					astronomy, information for STEM-employees in and around Exeter regarding the newly-launched
					LGBTQ+ Physical Sciences Network, and promoted the work of individuals within the LGBTQ+ 
					STEM community. The success of this event was helped by involvement from the Institute of

						<h3><a href="#">Perseids in the Park outreach event</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>Joined by a group of four astronomy PhD students from the University of Exeter, 
					I took around 50 residents of the Heavitree district of Exeter on a tour of the 
					summer skies including constellations such as Aquilla, Lyra and Cygnus in the Summer
					Triangle and also Ursa Minor, Cassiopeia and Perseus. We were also treated to the 
					beautiful sight of the Perseid meteor shower. The event was organised in association 
					with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Squilometres/">Heavitree Squilometre</a> 
					project. Credit to Chris Spinks for the photograph.
