          <p>I am currently a European Research Council funded Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, UK, 
		  in the research group of Prof. <a href="http://www.skraus.eu/">Stefan Kraus</a>. 
          <p>My present research is focussed on the analysis of near-infrared interferometric observations of protoplanetary 
		  disks using worldwide astronomical facilities such as the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy 
		  (<a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/">CHARA</a>) and the Very Large Telescope Interferometer 
		  (<a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti.html">VLTI</a>). To analyse these 
		  observations, I use and develop the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, 
		  <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/th2/torus_html/homepage.html" >TORUS</a>, originally developed by 
		  <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/th2/">Prof. Tim Harries</a>. I also use and develop the Exeter 
		  geometrical modelling pipeline, RAPIDO (Radiative transfer and Analytic modelling Pipeline for 
		  Interferometric Disk Observations), to model continuum and line emission from disks. These analyses probe the 
		  innermost regions of proto-planetary disks, allowing us to study their geometry, composition and shape. From 
		  this, we can learn more about planet formation and disk accretion processes. Further details regarding 
		  my scientific research can be found <a href="research.html">here</a> and further information regarding my 
		  observing experience is provided <a href="observing.html">here</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Prior to arriving in Exeter in October 2015, I worked at the University of St Andrews, UK, as an STFC STEP Fellow 
		  following the completion of my PhD at the same institution in April 2015. My PhD thesis, entitled "Revolution 
		  evolution: tracing angular momentum during star and planetary system formation" focussed on observationally 
		  probing the efficiency of stellar spin down during gravitational collapse together with quantifying the 
		  circumstellar angular momentum retained within planetary systems at various stages of formation. A copy of my 
		  thesis can be downloaded following links provided in my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> section.</p>
          
          <p>Aside from my scientific research, I am also involved in various public outreach activites. Details of these can be 
		  found in the <a href="talks.html">outreach</a> section. I am a member of the Institute of Physics and a Fellow
		  of the Royal Astronomical Society. I have recently been co-opted onto the IOP South West branch committee with
		  the aim of delivering physics related events to communities in the South West of England. I also sit on the 
		  University of Exeter's Physics and Astronomy 
		  <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/inclusivity/group/">Inclusivity Working Group</a>
		  which is working towards creating a more inclusive work environment celebrating the diversity of all
		  staff and students. I am also a member of the 
		  <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/staff/equality/inclusivitynetworksandgroups/lgbtqnetwork/">University of Exeter's 
		  LGBTQ+ staff</a> coordinators group.</p>

						<h3><a href="#">Launch of PRISM Exeter</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>In conjunction with the first International day for LGBTQ+ people in STEM (Science,
					Technology, Engineering & Mathematics), I, with assistance from employees of the Met
					Office, Exeter Science Park, and fellow members of the College of Engineering, Mathematics
					and Physical Sciences at the University of Exeter, have launched an Exeter-wide network
					for LGBTQ+ people working in STEM fields. The network will be known as PRISM Exeter and
					more information will follow in the coming weeks.

						<h3><a href="#">Talk awarded at ESO's Take a Closer Look Workshop</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>I received news that the talk abstract I submitted for ESO's Take A Closer Look
					Workshop due to take place at ESO Garching in October has been accepted. In the talk,
					I will discuss the work I have been doing modelling CHARA/CLIMB observations of 
					a young stellar object (HD 142666) with the TORUS radiative transfer code.
					</p>
					<p>In conjunction with this, I also successfully managed to acquire funds to cover the
					conference attendance fees of three post-docs (including myself) and a PhD student from
					our interferometry group in Exeter as well as the accomodation fees of the student. This
					has facilitated the attendance of a large portion of our group to attend and present our
					work at this workshop.

						<h3><a href="#">CHARA Observing run with MIRCx</a></h3>

					<p>I am back on Mount Wilson for the second month in a row to conduct observations of 
					pre-main sequence binaries (CHARA proposal 2018A:M4) and young stellar objects 
					(proposal 2018A:M3).

						<h3><a href="#">CHARA Observing run with MIRCx</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>As part of my role within the MIRCx collaboration, I visited CHARA to conduct 
					observations of young stellar objects during the ongoing installation of adaptive optics 
					systems (CHARA proposal 2018A:M5), the engineering of our new camera for the 
					six-telescope beam combiner, MIRCx (CHARA proposal 2018A:M2) and 
					for the 2018A:M4 program to study pre-main-sequence star binary systems. On UT date 
					May 24th, with the assistance of Narsireddy Anugu, Aaron Labdon and Alex Kreplin, we
					successfully deomstrated the remote observing capabilities of MIRCx from the University
					of Exeter directly for the first time. This is a fantastic step forward in making UK-based
					MIRCx observations more economical and provides us with a training utility for future
					UK-based CHARA Array users.

						<h3><a href="#">Institute of Physics south west branch stall at Exeter Pride</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>For the 10th anniversary of Exeter Pride - the local LGBTQ+ festival (and largest in
					Devon) - I organised for the South West branch of the Institute of Physics to have a 
					stall in the "marketplace" area. This was the first time a science-themed stall or event
					had featured at the festival. The stall featured hands-on demonstrations of physics and
					astronomy, information for STEM-employees in and around Exeter regarding the newly-launched
					LGBTQ+ Physical Sciences Network, and promoted the work of individuals within the LGBTQ+ 
					STEM community. The success of this event was helped by involvement from the Institute of
					Physics, the Royal Astronomical Society, Pride in STEM and volunteers from the University
					of Exeter, the Met Office, and Network Rail.

						<h3><a href="#">Public outreach talk for Plymouth Astronomical Society</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>I returned for the second time to Plymouth Astronomical Society, this time to present
					a talk on "Star and Planetary System Formation". The talk outlined how stars form, how 
					planets form, and what else constitutes a planetary system. I spoke at the end about some
					of the unanswered questions regarding the formation of high-obliquity hot Jupiters and
					how I intend to begin to answer these questions using optical interferometry. The talk, 
					attended by ~50 people, was well received with lots of interesting questions.
