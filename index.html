          <p>I am currently a European Research Council funded Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, UK, 
		  in the research group of Prof. <a href="http://www.skraus.eu/">Stefan Kraus</a>. 
          <p>My present research is focussed on the analysis of near-infrared interferometric observations of protoplanetary 
		  disks using worldwide astronomical facilities such as the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy 
		  (<a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/">CHARA</a>) and the Very Large Telescope Interferometer 
		  (<a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti.html">VLTI</a>). To analyse these 
		  observations, I use and develop the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, 
		  <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/th2/torus_html/homepage.html" >TORUS</a>, originally developed by 
		  <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/th2/">Prof. Tim Harries</a>. I also use and develop the Exeter 
		  geometrical modelling pipeline, RAPIDO (Radiative transfer and Analytic modelling Pipeline for 
		  Interferometric Disk Observations), to model continuum and line emission from disks. These analyses probe the 
		  innermost regions of proto-planetary disks, allowing us to study their geometry, composition and shape. From 
		  this, we can learn more about planet formation and disk accretion processes. Further details regarding 
		  my scientific research can be found <a href="research.html">here</a> and further information regarding my 
		  observing experience is provided <a href="observing.html">here</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Prior to arriving in Exeter in October 2015, I worked at the University of St Andrews, UK, as an STFC STEP Fellow 
		  following the completion of my PhD at the same institution in April 2015. My PhD thesis, entitled "Revolution 
		  evolution: tracing angular momentum during star and planetary system formation" focussed on observationally 
		  probing the efficiency of stellar spin down during gravitational collapse together with quantifying the 
		  circumstellar angular momentum retained within planetary systems at various stages of formation. A copy of my 
		  thesis can be downloaded following links provided in my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> section.</p>
          
          <p>Aside from my scientific research, I am also involved in various public outreach activites. Details of these can be 
		  found in the <a href="talks.html">outreach</a> section. I am a member of the Institute of Physics, a Fellow
		  of the Royal Astronomical Society, and a Junior Member of the International Astronomical Union. I am an 
		  ordinary member of the IOP South West branch committee with the aim of delivering more diverse 
		  physics-related events to communities in the South West of England. I also sit on the University of Exeter's 
		  Physics and Astronomy 
		  <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/inclusivity/group/">Inclusivity Working Group</a>
		  which is working towards creating a more inclusive work environment celebrating the diversity of all
		  staff and students. I am also the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Science's coordinator for 
		  the 
		  <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/staff/equality/lgbtqatexeter/staff-support/">University of 
		  Exeter's LGBTQ+ staff network</a>.</p>

						<h3><a href="#">Talk at Fordingbridge Astronomical Society</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>I was invited to speak to members of the Fordingbridge Astronomical Society in 
					Dorset on the formation of stars and their planetary systems. The event was 
					well-attended by around 30 astronomy enthusiasts and I spoke about star formation
					theory in general as well as highlighting my current research area of star-disk
					misalignment.

						<h3><a href="#">Community Star Gazing event</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>Following on from successful events held in the Heavitree and St Loyes wards
					in Exeter in previous years, I organised a 
					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/283698245673519">star gazing event</a> in 
					Belmont Park, central Exeter in collaboration with the Mount Pleasant and Pinhoe 
					Community Builders. We had over 200 visitors of all ages to the park which makes this
					event the most succesful of our "Park in the Dark" series. As the event nicely 
					coincided with the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, I and colleagues
					from the University of Exeter's Astrophysics Group were keenly promoting the work of 
					female scientists. Also, as the event took place during LGBT History Month, we were 
					using diffraction glasses to spark conversations about the analysis of spectra in 
					physics and astronomy but also how it is important to remember the diverse range of 
					people who do science.

					<p>I am honoured to have been nominated for an Academic Recognition Award for my
					work in improving diversity in STEM and my outreach activities by colleagues
					in the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences at the University of
					Exeter. More information can be found

						<h3><a href="#">Talk at University of Leeds</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>I visited the disk group of the Physics and Astronomy department at the University 
					of Leeds and gave a seminar to undergraduate students, postgraduate students, and 
					staff about recent results from the CHARA survey of YSOs and my recent paper on 
					star-disk misalignment.

						<h3><a href="#">PRISM Speakers talk</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>I gave a talk summarising the LGBTSTEMinar as part of "PRISM Speakers". PRISM is
					a local LGBTQ+ network for people working and studying in STEM which I founded in 
					July 2018. I summarised the amazing work being done by LGBTQ+ researchers in the UK 
					and further afield which was show-cased at the meeting and also led a discussion on
					the impacts that the internationalism of STEM research can have on its LGBTQ+ 
					researchers and students.
