	    diverse teams benefit from a variety of lived experiences which help shape their ideas
	    and approaches to problem solving - and the benefits of data monitoring.

           <p>
            I conducted 8 nights of observations as part of our young stellar
            object survey with MIRC-X at CHARA. Due to the length of this 
            observing run, these observations were conducted in situ rather than
            remotely.

           <p>
            For the second year running, I organised for the Institute of 
            Physics South West branch to be present at Exeter Pride. We marched 
            alongside other science and technology groups within Exeter under 
            the banner of "Proud to be a Scientist", handing out diffraction 
            glasses to spectators along the parade. At our stall, we spoke to
            the public about what physicists do and what physics is, using 
            Marvin and Milo experiments, an infrared camera loaned to us by the 
            Met Office, and some astronomy outreach kit from the University of 
            Exeter.

            As part of the commissioning of the MIRC-X instrument at the CHARA

            remotely from Exeter, removing the need to travel to LA for 
            single-night or two-night observing runs. On this occassion, the 
            weather was better in Exeter than it was in LA and we were only able
            to obtain one bracket of data on a young star and its circumstellar 
            disk.
