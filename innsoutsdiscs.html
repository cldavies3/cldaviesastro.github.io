			 <p>Akin to the asteroid and Kuiper belts of our Solar System, debris disks are 
			    comprised of solids from micron to kilometre size scales. These objects are 
			    understood to have formed via collisions between planetesimals and other smaller 
			    cosmic bodies around stars and are thus not primordial like the protoplanetary 
			    disks. Cold debris disks glow at sub-millimetre wavelengths, resulting in a 
			    characteristic "excess" of infrared emission in the spectral energy distribution 
			    of the object.
       </p>
       
       <h3>Thesis work:</h3>
       <p>During my PhD, I was part of the SONS JCMT Legacy Survey team which aimed 
			    to survey 100 of the closest stars to the Sun known to display such excess infrared 
			    emission. In total, we detected disks around 49 of the 100 stars surveyed at 
			    850 microns using the SCUBA-2 instrument of the James Clark Maxwell Telescope 
			    located on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i. These disks are ring-like and, using two-dimensional
			    Gaussian fits to their intensity, we found them to be situated between tens and 
			    hundreds of astronomical units from their host stars.
       </p>
       <h3>Present/future work:</h3>
			 <p>I am now part of the REASONS survey team (led by Luca Matra) which succesfully proposed for higher 
			    resolution observations of debris disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)
			    and the submillimeter array (SMA). These observations aim to investigate whether a 
			    common formation mechanism for debris disks exists.
       </p>
			 <p>I am also co-PI of a complimentary project using the Gravity instrument of the VLTI
			    to observe the stellar hosts of a handful of REASONS debris disks. With this data, we
			    are looking to investigate the degree of alignment between the rotation axis of the star
			    and the orbital axis of its disk.

			<article>
			 <p>My principal research at present concerns the structure and geometry of disks that exist around 
          stars as they form (see below). I am also involved in projects concerned with spatially 
          resolving debris disks (see panel to left).

				<h2>Protoplanetary Disks</h2>
			 </header>
			 <span class="image featured"><img src="images/visitOutput.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>Protoplanetary disks are so-called as they are the sites of planet formation. The disks themselves form
         during star formation: a natural consequence of the collapse of the rotating molecular cloud core. 
         Comprised predominantly of gas, the solid material constitutes only around 1% of the mass of the disk. 
         These solids, collectively referred to as "dust", are of critical importance to the formation of planets 
         by bottom-up processes such as core accretion. 
      </p>
			<p>I use long baseline optical interferometry to study the innermost regions of these dusty disks. In 
         interferometry, the light from multiple telescopes separated by tens to hundreds of metres is combined into
         one signal. This allows us to attain angular resolutions better than a milli-arcsecond (mas). One mas is 
         roughly equivalent to the area of sky subtended by a five pence piece held 4000 kilometres (about 2500 miles) 
         away!
      </p>
			<p>I use interferometric instruments such as <a href="https://cldaviesastro.github.io/CHARA.html">MIRC-X</a>
         and <a href="https://cldaviesastro.github.io/VLTI.html">Gravity</a> to observe at infrared wavelengths. With 
         this, my observations are sensitive to the hot gas and dust which exists in the very inner regions of 
         protoplanetary disks. Focusing on these regions allows me to study planet formation, stellar mass accretion 
         and outflow generation (to name but a few). 
      </p>
      
			<h3>Dust sublimation and the inner disk edge</h3>
			<p>I use observations obtained at the CHARA array to study the shape of the dusty circumstellar environments 
         of young stars, in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Exeter and the University of Michigan. 
         I am leading the analysis on two young stars, HD 142666 and RY Tau and assisting with the analysis of another
         young star, SU Aur. 
      </p>
			<p>As dust grains grow in size and settle towards the midplane of the disk, they alter the shape of the disk inner 
         rim as the larger grains are able to cool more efficiently and survive at hotter temperatures. I am using the 
         Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, TORUS, developed at the University of Exeter, to study the astrophysical 
         processes that govern the shape and structure of the innermost disk regions. Results for HD 142666 using disk-only
         models were recently published in The Astrophysical Journal and can be accessed 
         <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...866...23D">here</a>.
      </p>
      
			<h3>Inclined disks and infrared photometric variability</h3>
			<p>A class of variable star named after the first of its kind to be discovered - UX Ori - display
			   photometric variability at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Periods of decreased
			   brightness are often accompanied by increases in polarisation, suggesting changes in 
			   the line-of-sight opacity are responsible for the observed variability. What causes 
			   the change in opacity is so far unclear with different authors suggesting an origin in
			   e.g. a dusty wind, a dusty disk or even unstable accretion onto the central star. Previous 
			   determinations of disk inclinations for UX Ori stars from infrared and submillimetre 
			   observations have supported the disk-based origin.
      </p>
			<p>I obtained short baseline K-band interferometric data for the UX Ori-type variable
			   star CO Ori A and its wide binary companion, CO Ori B. Through geometric modelling of
			   the observed visibility amplitudes and closure phases, I found that the geometry of the
			   disk is inconsistent with the changes in the line-of-sight opacity having disk-based origins.
			   Instead, the relatively low inclination found for the disk around CO Ori A provides the 
			   first indication that circumstellar material above and below the disk is required to 
			   explain the UX Ori phenomena. This work was published in the Monthly
			   Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. A free version of the article is available
			   to access <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10244">here</a>.
