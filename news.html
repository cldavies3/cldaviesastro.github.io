           <p>
            I did an interview with 1 Million Women in STEM, a global campaign to
            raise the profile of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and
            Mathematics (STEM) and to give the female generations of the future
            role models in STEM fields. A write-up of the interview can be found

           To reduce the spread of COVID-19, I began working from home. As an

            binoculars in the limited amount of time it was behind thin rather than 
            thick cloud, we relied on the table-top activities to spur discussions
            about astronomy with visitors. Visitors learned about magnetism in the
            Solar System, about reflector telescope optics, and about constellation
            mythology in different cultures around the world.

            I undertook training with the newly installed six telescope simulator 
            (STS) which dramatically improves the phase calibration.

           <p>
            For the second year running, I organised for the Institute of 
            Physics South West branch to be present at Exeter Pride. We marched 
            alongside other science and technology groups within Exeter under 
            the banner of "Proud to be a Scientist", handing out diffraction 
            glasses to spectators along the parade. At our stall, we spoke to
            the public about what physicists do and what physics is, using 
            Marvin and Milo experiments, an infrared camera loaned to us by the 
            Met Office, and some astronomy outreach kit from the University of 
            Exeter.

            remotely from Exeter, removing the need to travel to LA for 
            single-night or two-night observing runs. On this occassion, the 
            weather was better in Exeter than it was in LA and we were only able
            to obtain one bracket of data on a young star and its circumstellar 
            disk.
