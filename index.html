          <p>I am currently a European Research Council funded Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, UK, 
		  in the research group of Prof. <a href="http://www.skraus.eu/">Stefan Kraus</a>. 
          <p>My present research is focussed on the analysis of near-infrared interferometric observations of protoplanetary 
		  disks using worldwide astronomical facilities such as the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy 
		  (<a href="http://www.chara.gsu.edu/">CHARA</a>) and the Very Large Telescope Interferometer 
		  (<a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/telescopes/vlti.html">VLTI</a>). To analyse these 
		  observations, I use and develop the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, 
		  <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/th2/torus_html/homepage.html" >TORUS</a>, originally developed by 
		  <a href="http://www.astro.ex.ac.uk/people/th2/">Prof. Tim Harries</a>. I also use and develop the Exeter 
		  geometrical modelling pipeline, RAPIDO (Radiative transfer and Analytic modelling Pipeline for 
		  Interferometric Disk Observations), to model continuum and line emission from disks. These analyses probe the 
		  innermost regions of proto-planetary disks, allowing us to study their geometry, composition and shape. From 
		  this, we can learn more about planet formation and disk accretion processes. Further details regarding 
		  my scientific research can be found <a href="research.html">here</a> and further information regarding my 
		  observing experience is provided <a href="observing.html">here</a>.</p>
          
          <p>Prior to arriving in Exeter in October 2015, I worked at the University of St Andrews, UK, as an STFC STEP Fellow 
		  following the completion of my PhD at the same institution in April 2015. My PhD thesis, entitled "Revolution 
		  evolution: tracing angular momentum during star and planetary system formation" focussed on observationally 
		  probing the efficiency of stellar spin down during gravitational collapse together with quantifying the 
		  circumstellar angular momentum retained within planetary systems at various stages of formation. A copy of my 
		  thesis can be downloaded following links provided in my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> section.</p>
          
          <p>Aside from my scientific research, I am also involved in various public outreach activites. Details of these can be 
		  found in the <a href="talks.html">outreach</a> section. I am a member of the Institute of Physics and a Fellow
		  of the Royal Astronomical Society. I have recently been co-opted onto the IOP South West branch committee with
		  the aim of delivering physics related events to communities in the South West of England. I also sit on the 
		  University of Exeter's Physics and Astronomy 
		  <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/inclusivity/group/">Inclusivity Working Group</a>
		  which is working towards creating a more inclusive work environment celebrating the diversity of all
		  staff and students. I am also a member of the 
		  <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/staff/equality/inclusivitynetworksandgroups/lgbtqnetwork/">University of Exeter's 
		  LGBTQ+ staff</a> coordinators group.</p>

						<h3><a href="#">Secured travel funding for LGBTSTEMinar18</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>Following promotion of the LGBTSTEMinar series across the 
					<a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/staff/equality/inclusivitynetworksandgroups/lgbtqnetwork/">
					University of Exeter's staff LGBTQ+ network</a>, I have been granted funding from the 
					University's College of 
					Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences to attend the third LGBTSTEMinar which
					is taking place at the University of York in January 2018. Further details about this 
					seminar series, which aims to bring together individuals working within STEM fields
					and who identify as LGBTQ+ to share their research and ideas, can be found 
					<a href="https://lgbtstem.wordpress.com/lgbt-steminar-2018/">here</a>.

						<h3><a href="#">Research trip to California</a></h3>
					</header>
					<p>I attended the Sagan/Michelson Symposium at CalTech for two days of talks by past
					and present Sagan, Michelson (and a couple of Hubble) fellows. This was a great 
					oportunity to speak with some of the best young minds in planetary science (and some
					older ones too). The rest of my trip was spent at the CHARA Array at Mount
					Wilson Observatory where I conducted observations of post-asymptotic giant branch 
					binary stars with the MIRCx six-telescope beam combiner.
					With six telescopes, we should be able to obtain sufficient u,v plane coverage to
					reconstruct images of these objects from the interferometric quantities obtained. These
					images will enable us to study the circum-stellar and circum-binary disks which exist
					around these evolved stars.
