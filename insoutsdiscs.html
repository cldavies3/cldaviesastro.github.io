           To learn more about the formation of stars and their planetary systems, it is useful
           to study circumstellar disc structure and evolution. The discs are referred to using 
           different names depending on the age of the system they reside in and the type of
           physics one is interested in learning from them. For instance, the otpically thick discs 
           of young, pre-main-sequence stars (less than around 10 million years old) are commonly referred to as either
           "protoplanetary discs" or "accretion discs" as they contain a mass reservoir that has the 
           potential to i) form planets and ii) be accreted onto the host star (or stars). Some 
           discs - known as debris discs - are formed via a collisional cascade of proto-planets
           and planetesimals and are primarily found around older, main sequence stars. 
          </p>
          <p class="style1">
           Peering into these discs requires high angular resolution observational techniques. One 
           such technique - interferometry - consists of combining the light from an array of 
           telescopes to obtain milli-arcsecond (sometimes even micro-arcsecond) resolution. To
           give some indication of how small that size-scale is, the full moon covers an area of sky
           equal to half a square degree. So this technique allows us to probe regions of the sky 
           that are up to 1,800,000,000 times smaller than the full moon!

          <p class="style1">
           These discs form as a natural consequence of angular momentum conservation during the
           gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core. Comprised predominantly of gas, the 
           solid material constitutes only around 1% of the mass of the disc. These solids, 
           collectively referred to as "dust", are of critical importance to the formation of 
           planets by bottom-up processes such as core accretion.
          </p>
          <p class="style1">
           Using optical long baseline interferometers, namely the CHARA Array and the Very Large
           Telescope Interferometer (VLTI), I study the shape and structure of the hot gas and 
           dust which exists in the innermost regions of these discs. As dust grains grow in size 
           and settle towards the midplane of the disc, they alter 
           the shape of the disc inner rim: the larger grains are able to cool more efficiently 
           and survive at hotter temperatures. I use the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, 
           TORUS, developed at the University of Exeter, to study the astrophysical processes 
           that govern the shape and structure of the innermost disc regions. Results for HD 142666 
           and RY Tau were recently published in the Astrophysical Journal. Please see
           my <a href="publications.html">publications</a> page for more information.
          </p>
          <p class="style1">
           The shape of the inner disc rim impacts on the amount of light that reaches the rest of
           the disc directly from the star and is reprocessed to longer wavelenghts. I use scattered
           light imaging obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) to study the surface layers of 
           the disc. By using multiple observational techniques, we can reveal more complex disc 
           structures such as deviations from radial power laws in the surface density and/or scale 
           height of the disc or radial variations in the disc viewing geometry due to disc warps
           and misalignments.

           <p>Stellar occultation by dusty discs and stellar variability</p>

          <p class="style1">
           A class of variable stars named after the first of its kind to be discovered - UX Ori - 
           display photometric variability at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Periods of 
           decreased brightness are often accompanied by increases in polarisation, suggesting 
           changes in the line-of-sight opacity are responsible for the observed variability. 
           What causes the change in opacity is so far unclear with different theories suggesting 
           an origin in e.g. a dusty wind, a dusty disc or even unstable accretion onto the central 
           star. Previous determinations of disc inclinations for UX Ori stars from infrared and 
           submillimetre observations have supported the disc-based origin.
          <p>
          <p class="style1">
           I obtained short baseline K-band interferometric data for the UX Ori-type variable star 
           CO Ori A and its wide binary companion, CO Ori B. Through geometric modelling of the 
           observed visibility amplitudes and closure phases, I found that the geometry of the 
           disc is inconsistent with the changes in the line-of-sight opacity having disc-based 
           origins. Instead, the relatively low inclination found for the disc around CO Ori A provides 
           the first indication that circumstellar material above and below the disc is required to 
           explain the UX Ori phenomena. This work was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal 
           Astronomical Society.

          <p class="style1">
           Akin to the asteroid and Kuiper belts of our Solar System, debris disks are comprised of 
           solids from micron to kilometre size scales. These objects are understood to have formed 
           via collisions between planetesimals and other smaller cosmic bodies around stars and are 
           thus not primordial like the protoplanetary discs. Cold debris discs glow at sub-millimetre 
           wavelengths, resulting in a characteristic "excess" of infrared emission in the spectral 
           energy distribution of the object.
          </p>
          <p class="style1">
           During my PhD, I was part of the SONS JCMT Legacy Survey team which aimed to survey 100 
           of the closest stars to the Sun known to display such excess infrared emission. In total, 
           we detected disks around 49 of the 100 stars surveyed at 850 microns using the SCUBA-2 
           instrument of the James Clark Maxwell Telescope located on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i. These discs 
           are ring-like and, using two-dimensional Gaussian fits to their intensity, we found them 
           to be situated between tens and hundreds of astronomical units from their host stars.
          </p>
          <p class="style1">
           I am now part of the REASONS survey team (led by Luca Matra) which succesfully proposed for 
           higher resolution observations of debris disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array 
           (ALMA) and the Submillimeter Array (SMA). These observations aim to investigate whether 
           a common formation location for debris discs exists which could help us learn more about
           planetesimal formation. The first paper from this collaboration was published in 2019
           with Aldo Sepulveda as lead author.
