			<span class="image featured"><img src="images/diskRadii.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>If stars conserved all their angular momentum during their gravitational
			collapse from molecular cloud cores their rotational velocities would be high 
			enough to tear themselves apart. This problem is exacerbated during the 
			accretion process, requiring stars to transfer away a large portion of 
			their angular momenta in order to avoid break-up. Using a sample of fully 
			convective stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster and the Taurus-Auriga star 
			forming region, I found that the rate of stellar angular momentum removal rate
			exceeded that predicted by simple disk-locking theories whereby stars
			contract at fixed rotation rates. Moreover, I found tentative evidence that
			the disparity between the rotation period distributions of fully convective 
			stars more massive than about 0.2 solar masses and their lower mass counterparts
			is due (at least in part) to the differences in their magnetic field 
			geometries. </p>
			<p>I am involved in projects looking further into the relationship between 
			stellar rotation rates during contraction towards the main sequence and the 
			stellar interior which impacts on the surface magnetic field strength and 
			topology. At present, the number of young stellar objects with mapped magnetic fields
			is small. I am involved in the scientific working group for SPiRou which aims
			to greatly increase this sample.<p>

				<h2>Debris disks</h2>
			</header>
			<span class="image featured"><img src="images/debrisDisks.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>Akin to the asteroid and Kuiper belts of our Solar System, debris disks are 
			comprised of solids from micron to kilometre size scales. These objects are 
			understood to have formed via collisions between planetesimals and other smaller 
			cosmic bodies around stars and are thus not primordial like the protoplanetary 
			disks. Located at large distances from their stars, debris disks are often cold 
			and glow at sub-millimetre wavelengths, resulting in a characteristic "excess" 
			infrared emission. I was part of the SONS JCMT Legacy Survey team which aimed 
			to survey 100 of the closest stars to the sun known to display such infrared 
			excesses. In total, we detected disks around 49 of the 100 stars surveyed at 
			850 microns using the SCUBA-2 instrument of the James Clark Maxwell Telescope 
			located on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i. These disks are ring-like and, using two-dimensional
			Gaussian fits to their intensity, we found them to be situated between tens and 
			hundreds of astronomical units from their host stars.</p>
			<p>We have submitted a proposal for higher resolution observations of debris disks
			with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, ALMA which we hope will shed light on, 
			amongst other things, why debris disks form at the locations they are found at.</p>

				<h2>Research Interests</h2>
				<p>My principal research at present concerns the structure and geometry of 
				disks that exist around stars as they form. This is described below. A selection
				of my other research interests can be seen in the left panel.</p>
			</header>
			<span class="image featured"><img src="images/visitOutput.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>These protoplanetary disks, so called due to their being the proposed sites of 
			planet formation, form as a natural consequence of the collapse of a rotating molecular 
			cloud core. Comprised predominantly of gas, the solid material constitutes only around 
			1% of the mass of the disk. Yet these solids, known as "dust" to astronomers, are
			of critical importance to the formation of planets by bottom-up processes such
			as core accretion. </p>
			<p>I use an observational method known as infrared interferometry to study the 
			innermost regions of these dusty disks. In interferometry, we combine the light
			from multiple telescopes separated by tens to hundreds of metres rather than 
			using a single telescope. This method allows us to attain angular resolutions 
			down to milli-arcsecond precision. That is equivalent to the area of sky subtended
			by a five pence piece held 4000 kilometres (about 2500 miles) away!</p>
			<p>By operating the interferometer at infrared wavelengths, we are sensitive to the
			hot gas and dust which exists in the very inner regions of protoplanetary disks 
			(within a few astronomical units). In these regions, not only do planets likely 
			form and evolve but the star also accretes material from the disk. Focusing on these
			regions enables us to study both of these processes. </p>
			<h3>Growth of dust grains</h3>
			<p>As protoplanetary disks evolve, collisions are expected to occur between the dusty 
			constituents of the disks. One of the most prominent theories of planet formation (the
			core accretion hypothesis) relies on a certain proportion of these collisions to result
			in sticking. Without such an outcome, it would not be possible to build planets via a
			bottom-up process.</p>
			<p>I am using near-infrared interferometric observations obtained with the two-telescope
			beam combiner, CLASSIC, and three-telescope beam combiner, CLIMB, at the CHARA array
			to study the shape of the dusty inner rim of the disks surrounding HD 142666 and RY Tau.
			As dust grains grow in size and settle towards the midplane of the disk, they alter the
			shape of the inner rim as the larger grains are able to survive at larger temperatures.
			I am using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, TORUS, developed at the University of
			Exeter (UK) to study the effects of different grain sizes on the shape of the inner rim and
			determine the degree of grain growth in the disks of these objects. </p>
			<h3>Inclined disks and infrared photometric variability</h3>
			<p>A class of variable stars named after the first of their kind, UX Ori, display
			photometric variability at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Periods of decreased
			brightness are often accompanied by increases in polarisation, suggesting changes in 
			the line-of-sight opacity are responsible for the observed variability. What causes 
			the change in opacity is so far unclear with different authors suggesting an origin in
			e.g. a dusty wind, a dusty disk or even unstable accretion onto the central star. </p>
			<p>I obtained short baseline K-band interferometric data for the UX Ori-type variable
			star CO Ori A and its wide binary companion, CO Ori B. Through geometric modelling of
			the observed visibility amplitudes and closure phases, I found that the geometry of the
			disk is consistent with the idea that changes in the line-of-sight opacity may have an
			origin in the upper reaches of a circumstellar disk. </p>
			<h3>Misalignment between disks in binary systems</h3>
			<p>As more and more planets are discovered around stars other than our Sun, we are finding
			more and more <i>exotic</i> types of exoplanets. One of these types of exoplanets are the 
			hot-Jupiters, so-called as they are a group of objects of Jupiter mass or larger which
			exist close to their host stars. If they were placed within our own Solar System, these planets
			would be located within the orbit of Mercury. Observations using a technique called the 
			Rossiter-McLaughlin effect have found that a subset of these hot-Jupiters are on orbits that
			are inclined with respect to their stellar hosts. </p>
			<p>There are three groups of theories to explain how this can happen: (i) the rotation axis of 
			the host star changes during its evolution towards the main sequence; (ii) the rotation axis of
			the exoplanet changes during its formation and migration inwards through its natal protoplanetary
			disk or; (iii) the rotation axis of the disk out which the planet forms may change. One method
			of enabling the latter of these options to occur is via the interaction of the star-disk system
			with a neighbouring star e.g. a binary. I am undertaking observations with the VLTI/GRAVITY 
			instrument to study the comparative alignment of disks in binary systems with their binary axes 
			in order to begin to assess the validity of this hypothesis. </p>
