      <p>Systemic inequalities exist within physics, astronomy, and the wider STEMM 
      (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) sector which 
      act as barriers to access to -- and progression through -- these 
      disciplines for women, minority groups, and those with limited access to 
      "science capital". I am committed to improving this situation through my work
      through my scientific outreach activities and through my active engagement in
      equity, diversity and inclusion work. </p>
      
      <p>I provide talks or workshops on LGBTQ+ inclusion within STEMM, in particular,
      and speak at events focussed on improving the gender balance in STEMM. See 
      <a href="inclusion-events.html">this page</a> for a list of events and activities I've recently 
      been involved in. For bookings and enquiries, please use my contact details 
      at the bottom of this page. </p>

      <p><a href="https://prismexeter.com">PRISM Exeter</a> serves as a network for LGBTQ+ individuals (and their allies) who work 
      or study within the local STEMM sectors. </p>
      
      <p>I founded <a href="https://prismexeter.com">PRISM Exeter</a> back in 
      July 2018 with support from employees and 
      representatives from Network Rail, Exeter Science Park, Tech Exeter, the 
      Met Office, and the University of Exeter. The decision to create such a 
      network came off the back of a positive response to a stall I organised for
      the Institute of Physics South West branch the previous May. </p>
      
      <p>In discussions with stall volunteers and other LGBTQ+ contacts within the 
      local STEMM community, there was a sense of geographical disconnect between 
      ourselves and existing company-wide or sector-wide LGBTQ+ groups. We wanted
      to provide a local network through which the discussions being had in 
      different areas of the country could be continued and further developed
      within the South West and particularly Exeter and its immediate surroundings.</p>
      
      <p>We aim to increase the visibility of the diverse range of people 
      working in STEMM, particularly LGBTQ+ individuals. We recognise the 
      importance of allies: for us, an ally is someone non-LGBTQ+ or not "out"
      as LGBTQ+ for whatever reason but who is interested in improving equality,
      diversity and inlcusion within STEMM. It is through working with (and listening
      to) allies - particularly those from other under-represented groups - that we 
      can achieve our aim of being intersectional. </p>

      <header class="style1"><strong>Institute of Physics South West Branch</strong></header>
      <p>The Insitute of Physics (IoP) South West branch coordinates the IoP's 
      activities within the counties of Gloucester, Devon, Somerset, and Cornwall. 
      I joined the branch committee as a volunteer in September 2017, intially with
      the aim of getting the IoP respresented at Exeter Pride. Our stall featuring 
      hands-on, copy-at-home physics and astronomy demonstrations was the first time
      the IoP had been involved at a Pride event outside of London or Brighton. </p>
      
      <p>I have continued to lead the IoP's involvement in Exeter Pride each year since
      then (although the 2020 event was postponed due to COVID-19). </p>
