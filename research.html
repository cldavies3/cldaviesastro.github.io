				<h2>Revolution evolution</h2>

			<span class="image featured"><img src="images/diskRadii.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>If stars conserved all their angular momentum during their gravitational
			collapse from molecular cloud cores their rotational velocities would be high 
			enough to tear themselves apart. This problem is exacerbated during the 
			accretion process, requiring stars to transfer away a large portion of 
			their angular momenta in order to avoid reaching break-up velocities. Using a sample of fully 
			convective stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster and the Taurus-Auriga star 
			forming regions, I found the stellar angular momentum removal rate
			exceeded that predicted by simple disk-locking theories whereby stars
			contract at fixed rotation rates. Moreover, I found tentative evidence that
			the disparity between the rotation period distributions of fully convective 
			stars more massive than about 0.2 solar masses and their lower mass counterparts
			is due (at least in part) to differences between their magnetic field 
			geometries. </p>
			<p>I am involved in projects looking further into the relationship between 
			stellar rotation rates during contraction towards the main sequence and the 
			stellar interior which impacts on the surface magnetic field strength and 
			topology. At present, the number of young stellar objects with mapped magnetic fields
			is small. I am part of the scientific working group for 
			<a href="http://spirou.irap.omp.eu/">SPiRou</a> which will uncover magnetic field 
			geometries and properties across the pre-main-sequence HR diagram.<p>

				<h2>Debris disks</h2>
			</header>
			<span class="image featured"><img src="images/debrisDisks.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>Akin to the asteroid and Kuiper belts of our Solar System, debris disks are 
			comprised of solids from micron to kilometre size scales. These objects are 
			understood to have formed via collisions between planetesimals and other smaller 
			cosmic bodies around stars and are thus not primordial like the protoplanetary 
			disks. Cold debris disks glow at sub-millimetre wavelengths, resulting in a 
			characteristic "excess" of infrared emission in the spectral energy distribution 
			of the object. I was part of the SONS JCMT Legacy Survey team which aimed 
			to survey 100 of the closest stars to the Sun known to display such excess infrared 
			emission. In total, we detected disks around 49 of the 100 stars surveyed at 
			850 microns using the SCUBA-2 instrument of the James Clark Maxwell Telescope 
			located on Mauna Kea, Hawai'i. These disks are ring-like and, using two-dimensional
			Gaussian fits to their intensity, we found them to be situated between tens and 
			hundreds of astronomical units from their host stars.</p>
			<p>I am part of the REASONS team (led by Luca Matra) which succesfully proposed for higher 
			resolution observations of debris disks with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)
			and the submillimeter array (SMA). These observations aim to investigate whether a 
			common formation mechanism for debris disks exists.</p>
			<p>I am also co-PI of a complimentary project using the VLTI/GRAVITY instrument
			to observe the stellar hosts of a handful of REASONS debris disks. With this data, we
			are looking to investigate the degree of alignment between the rotation axis of the star
			and the orbital axis of its disk.

				<h2>Research Interests</h2>
				<p>My principal research at present concerns the structure and geometry of 
				disks that exist around stars as they form. This is described below. A selection
				of my other research interests can be seen in the left panel.</p>
			</header>
			<span class="image featured"><img src="images/visitOutput.png" alt="" /></span>
			<p>These protoplanetary disks, so called due to their being the proposed sites of 
			planet formation, form as a natural consequence of the collapse of a rotating molecular 
			cloud core. Comprised predominantly of gas, the solid material constitutes only around 
			1% of the mass of the disk. Yet these solids, collectively referred to as "dust", are
			of critical importance to the formation of planets by bottom-up processes such
			as core accretion. </p>
			<p>I use an observational method known as infrared interferometry to study the 
			innermost regions of these dusty disks. In interferometry, we combine the light
			from multiple telescopes separated by tens to hundreds of metres rather than 
			using a single telescope. This method allows us to attain angular resolutions 
			down to milli-arcsecond precision. That is equivalent to the area of sky subtended
			by a five pence piece held 4000 kilometres (about 2500 miles) away!</p>
			<p>By operating the interferometer at infrared wavelengths, we are sensitive to the
			hot gas and dust which exists in the very inner regions of protoplanetary disks. 
			Focusing on these regions enables us to study planet formation, stellar mass accretion
			and outflow generation, to name but a few. </p>
			<h3>Growth of dust grains</h3>
			<p>As protoplanetary disks evolve, collisions are expected to occur between the dusty 
			constituents of the disks. One of the most prominent theories of planet formation (the
			core accretion hypothesis) relies on a certain proportion of these collisions to result
			in sticking. Without such an outcome, it would not be possible to build planets via a
			bottom-up process.</p>
			<p>I am using near-infrared interferometric observations obtained with the two-telescope
			beam combiner, CLASSIC, and three-telescope beam combiner, CLIMB, at the CHARA array
			to study the shape of the dusty inner rim of the disks surrounding two stars: HD 142666 and RY Tau.
			As dust grains grow in size and settle towards the midplane of the disk, they alter the
			shape of the inner rim as the larger grains are able to survive at larger temperatures.
			I am using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, TORUS, developed at the University of
			Exeter (UK) to study the effects of different grain sizes on the shape of the inner rim and
			determine the degree of grain growth in the disks of these objects. </p>
			<h3>Inclined disks and infrared photometric variability</h3>
			<p>A class of variable stars named after the first of their kind, UX Ori, display
			photometric variability at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Periods of decreased
			brightness are often accompanied by increases in polarisation, suggesting changes in 
			the line-of-sight opacity are responsible for the observed variability. What causes 
			the change in opacity is so far unclear with different authors suggesting an origin in
			e.g. a dusty wind, a dusty disk or even unstable accretion onto the central star. Previous 
			determinations of disk inclinations for UX Ori stars from infrared and submillimetre 
			observations has provided evidence for the disk-based origin.</p>
			<p>I obtained short baseline K-band interferometric data for the UX Ori-type variable
			star CO Ori A and its wide binary companion, CO Ori B. Through geometric modelling of
			the observed visibility amplitudes and closure phases, I found that the geometry of the
			disk is inconsistent with the changes in the line-of-sight opacity having disk-based origins.
			Instead, the relatively low inclination found for the disk around CO Ori A provides the 
			first indication that circumstellar material above and below the disk is required to 
			explain the UX Ori phenomena. This work has recently been published in the Monthly
			Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. A free version of the article is available
			<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10244">here</a>.</p>
			<h3>Misalignment between disks in binary systems</h3>
			<p>As more and more planets are discovered around stars other than our Sun, we are finding
			more and more <i>exotic</i> types of exoplanets. One of these types of exoplanets are the 
			hot-Jupiters, so-called as they are a group of objects of Jupiter mass or larger which
			exist close to their host stars. If they were placed within our own Solar System, these planets
			would be located within the orbit of Mercury. Observations using a technique called the 
			Rossiter-McLaughlin effect have found that a subset of these hot-Jupiters are on orbits that
			are inclined with respect to their stellar hosts. </p>
			<p>There are three groups of theories to explain how this can happen: (i) the rotation axis of 
			the host star changes during its evolution towards the main sequence; (ii) the rotation axis of
			the exoplanet changes during its formation and migration inwards through its natal protoplanetary
			disk or; (iii) the rotation axis of the disk out which the planet forms may change. One method
			of enabling the latter of these options to occur is via the interaction of the star-disk system
			with a neighbouring star e.g. a binary. I am undertaking observations with the VLTI/GRAVITY 
			instrument to study the comparative alignment of disks in binary systems with their binary axes 
			in order to begin to assess the validity of this hypothesis. </p>
